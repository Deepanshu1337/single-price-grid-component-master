## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Through this project, I enhanced my understanding of CSS Grid and Flexbox. I learned how to effectively use grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns to create complex layouts. Additionally, I gained experience with responsive design techniques, ensuring that the component looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Continued development

I plan to continue improving my skills in CSS Grid and Flexbox. In future projects, I aim to explore more advanced CSS properties and techniques, such as CSS animations and transitions. Additionally, I want to deepen my knowledge of JavaScript to add more interactivity to my projects.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - CSS Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) - This helped me understand the basics of CSS Grid.
- [CSS Tricks - A Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to use CSS Grid. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
